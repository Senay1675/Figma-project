I would recomend to preview the site in a Macbook Pro 14" to get the best format.

## Fonts that i used:

- Quicksand
- Bai Jamjuree
- Atomic Age
- Font Awsome 6

## Click on the links to get access to every Font

```HTML
 <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?query=quicksand">
 <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bai+Jamjuree?query=Bai+jam">
 <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atomic+Age?query=Atomic+">
 <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fontawesome.com/icons">
```

I wanted to choose font awesome brands for the all the logos in my website but it did not work for all logo only those in the footer, so i had to download the logos on the kontakt sida directly from fontawsome website.

I choose to export the foto in .avif because it took the least amount of memory, and my fallback option is in .jpg incase avif dosent work on all platforms.
